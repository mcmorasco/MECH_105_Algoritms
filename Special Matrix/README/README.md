# Special Matrix Algorithm
---
This algorithm creates an n x m matrix where:
* The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column
* The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row
* The rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left

## Inputs:
* n=number of rows
* m=number of columns

*The algorithm will return an error if the user does not input exactly two arguments*
## Output:
* Special matrix with the parameters specified above
